Javascript Frogger Game

== Introduction ==

This is a frogger game made for the final project of an Object-Oriented JavaScript course offered by Udacity (https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015). I am very excited to share it with you all and I hope you will enjoy the game as much as I did making it!

== Story ==

Our main character, Spot, was playing by the river with his friends when he got lost! Give spot a hand by navigating him towards the cool river water. Watch out for obstacles such as heavy rocks and scary bugs!

== Installation Instructions ==

Click on the "Clone or Download" link and download the repository as a ZIP file. Extract the contents and "right-click" on the index.html file and open with your favorite browser (preferably Google Chrome) to play!

== How to Play == 

Arrow Keys : Moves the character around.

Spacebar: Certain characters have active skills. Each skill is different and you must possess the required amount of star power to activate.

== Collectibles ==

Blue Gem = A common gemstone, collect these to add 100 points!

Green Gem = A uncommon gemstone, collect these for an extra 250 points!

Ruby Gem = A rare gemstone, I wonder who dropped this here? Adds 1000 points!

Heart = Gives you an extra life (upwards to a maximum of 5).

Star = Mysterious and powerful energy. Collect these to use character skills!

Key = ???

== Obstacles ==

Rock = A big rock. Super heavy and impassable. You cannot move over these.

== Enemies == 

Red Bug = Your standard evil bug, roughly the same size as you. Avoid at all costs!

Green Bug = Evil sewer bugs. They have augmented sense of direction.

Purple Bugs = Sneaky little buggers. Like ninjas, they can vanish for a peroid of time.

Yellow Bugs = These bugs have absorbed star power and are able to super charge themselves.

== Current Issues ==

1. The orange gem should be removed from the game
